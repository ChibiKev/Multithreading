## Multithreading
Project for CSC 332 - Operating Systems with Professor Zaid Al-Mashhadni at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
- There is a file.txt. that contains 50,000,000 random words (e.g. Communication,
Protocols, and Architecture), and we wrote a serial program (single thread) to read it. After that, the program will copy the words to some form of a list to find:
  1. The longest word
  2. The shortest word
  3. The most common word
- Then, improve your program utilizing multiple threads equal to the number of the cores you have on your machine. After reading the words to the same list by a single thread, divide the list evenly between the pool of threads, so that each thread will do the same search concurrently.
## Additional Information
- There are comments in the code that illustrates the thought process and exactly what each line of code is doing.
